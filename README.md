# 🏥 Insurance Charges Prediction App
## 🌐 **[Click Here to See the Model Live!](https://insurance-3u7q.onrender.com/)** 🚀

This project predicts **medical insurance charges** based on personal details such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region.  
It uses a **Machine Learning model** trained on the `insurance.csv` dataset and provides a **Flask web app** interface for user input.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset (`insurance.csv`) contains the following columns:

- `age` → Age of the individual  
- `sex` → Gender (`male` / `female`)  
- `bmi` → Body Mass Index  
- `children` → Number of children  
- `smoker` → Smoking status (`yes` / `no`)  
- `region` → Residential region (`northeast`, `northwest`, `southeast`, `southwest`)  
- `charges` → Medical insurance cost (Target variable)
